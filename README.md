Implementation of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm in Python with an application for solving the LASSO problem.

The code first defines the functions used in the implementation of the algorithm, then conducts a series of tests to look at the *sensitivity* of the algorithm to changes in the optimization problem: the number of observations (n), the numbere of parameters (p).
